    D. `nmap -sn <target>`

2.  **What is the primary purpose of the Metasploit Framework?**
    A. To analyze network packet captures.
    B. To crack password hashes.
    C. To develop, test, and execute exploits.
    D. To intercept and modify web traffic.

3.  **In Burp Suite, which tool is primarily used to intercept, view, and modify HTTP/S requests and responses in real-time?**
    A. Repeater
    B. Intruder
    C. Decoder
    D. Proxy (Intercept)

    A. `airmon-ng`
    B. `aireplay-ng`
    C. `airodump-ng`
    D. `aircrack-ng`

5.  **If you want to attempt to crack a captured WPA/WPA2 handshake using a wordlist, which Aircrack-ng tool would you primarily use?**
    A. `airmon-ng`
    B. `airodump-ng`
    C. `aireplay-ng`
    D. `aircrack-ng`

## True/False

6.  **True or False:** Wireshark can only capture traffic on wired Ethernet networks, not Wi-Fi.
7.  **True or False:** John the Ripper can use dictionary attacks and brute-force attacks to crack passwords.
8.  **True or False:** The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) can only be used for host discovery.

## Short Answer

9.  What is a "payload" in the context of Metasploit? Give an example of what a payload might do.
10. What is the main difference between Nmap's `-sS` (SYN scan) and `-sT` (Connect scan)?
11. Why would an ethical hacker use Burp Suite's "Repeater" tool?
12. What is "monitor mode" for a wireless network card, and why is it necessary for tools like Aircrack-ng?
