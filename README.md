## Important Disclaimer

**Ethical Use and Legal Compliance:**
The information and tools provided in this repository are for educational purposes only. The goal is to help individuals learn about cybersecurity and ethical hacking techniques to better understand how to protect systems and data.

-   **Permission is Paramount:** You must have explicit, written permission from the owner of any system or network before conducting any form of testing, scanning, or any activity that could be construed as "hacking." Unauthorized access to or testing of computer systems is illegal and unethical.
-   **Use a Safe Lab Environment:** For any practical exercises, especially those involving tools that scan or interact with systems, it is strongly recommended that you use a dedicated and isolated lab environment that you own (e.g., virtual machines on your own computer, specifically designed vulnerable applications like OWASP Juice Shop or Metasploitable2). Do not practice these techniques on live production systems, public networks, or any system for which you do not have clear authorization.
-   **Know the Law:** Be aware of and comply with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws regarding computer security and cybercrime.
-   **Responsibility:** You are solely responsible for your actions. The maintainers of this repository are not responsible for any misuse of the information or tools provided herein.

By using this repository, you agree that you will use the knowledge and tools responsibly, ethically, and in compliance with all applicable laws. If you are unsure about the legality or ethics of a particular action, seek guidance or refrain from that action.

Happy (and ethical) learning!
