# Snyk Tutorial: AI-Powered Vulnerability Scanning

This tutorial will guide you through using Snyk, a powerful tool that helps developers find and fix vulnerabilities in their code, dependencies, and infrastructure.

## 1. Introduction to Snyk

### What is Snyk?
Snyk is a developer-first security platform that helps you build secure applications and accelerate your development lifecycle. It scans for vulnerabilities in your open source dependencies, container images, infrastructure as code (IaC) configurations, and your own code.

### How it uses AI
Snyk leverages AI, including technology from its acquisition of DeepCode AI, to enhance its vulnerability detection capabilities. This AI helps in:
*   Identifying complex vulnerabilities that might be missed by traditional signature-based scanning.
*   Providing more accurate and context-aware vulnerability analysis.
*   Suggesting more effective remediation advice.
*   Learning from a vast dataset of code and vulnerabilities to continuously improve its detection models.

### Benefits for Developers
*   **Find and Fix Early:** Integrates directly into developer workflows (IDE, CLI, Git), allowing vulnerabilities to be found and fixed early in the development process.
*   **Actionable Insights:** Provides clear explanations of vulnerabilities and actionable remediation advice.
*   **Automated Scans:** Automates security testing, saving developers time and effort.
*   **Prioritization:** Helps prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and exploitability.
*   **Broad Coverage:** Supports a wide range of languages, frameworks, and ecosystems.

## 2. Setting up a Free Snyk Account

Snyk offers a generous free tier for individual developers and open-source projects.

1.  **Go to the Snyk website:** Open your web browser and navigate to [https://snyk.io/](https://snyk.io/).
2.  **Sign Up:** Click on the "Sign up" or "Get started for free" button.
3.  **Choose an Authentication Method:** You can typically sign up using your GitHub, Google, or Bitbucket account, or by using your email address. Using a version control system account (like GitHub) is often convenient for later integration.
4.  **Follow On-Screen Instructions:** Complete the registration process by following the prompts.
5.  **Free Tier:** Once signed up, you'll usually be on the free tier, which provides a certain number of tests per month for open source and private projects (check Snyk's current offerings for details).

## 3. Installing and Authenticating Snyk CLI

The Snyk Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to scan projects directly from your terminal.

### Installation
You can install the Snyk CLI using various package managers. Here are a couple of common methods:

*   **Using npm (Node Package Manager):**
    ```bash
    npm install -g snyk
    ```
*   **Using Homebrew (macOS):**
    ```bash
    brew tap snyk/tap
    brew install snyk
    ```
*   **Other methods:** Check the official Snyk CLI documentation for more installation options (e.g., Scoop for Windows, manual download).

### Authentication
Once installed, you need to authenticate the CLI with your Snyk account:

1.  Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    snyk auth
    ```
2.  This command will open a browser window asking you to log in to your Snyk account (if you aren't already logged in) and then to authenticate the CLI.
3.  Click "Authenticate" or "Authorize" in the browser.
4.  Return to your terminal. You should see a success message, e.g., "Your account has been authenticated. Snyk is ready to be used."

## 4. Creating an Example Project (for scanning)

Let's create a simple Python project with known vulnerabilities to demonstrate Snyk's capabilities.

Create a directory for your example project, for instance, `snyk_example_project`. Inside this directory, create the following two files:

**File: `snyk_example_project/requirements.txt`**
```
flask==0.5
requests==2.18.0
```

**File: `snyk_example_project/app.py`**
```python
from flask import Flask
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
This setup includes old versions of `flask` and `requests`, which are known to have vulnerabilities.

*(The worker will create these files in the `ai_vulnerability_scanning/snyk_example_project/` directory as part of this task.)*

## 5. Scanning with Snyk CLI

Now that you have an example project, you can scan it using the Snyk CLI.

Navigate to your example project's root directory in your terminal:
```bash
cd path/to/your/ai_vulnerability_scanning/snyk_example_project
```

### Scanning Open Source Dependencies
To scan your open source dependencies (defined in `requirements.txt` for our Python example):
```bash
snyk test
```

### Scanning Code (Snyk Code)
To scan your custom code for security issues (e.g., in `app.py`):
```bash
snyk code test
```
*(Note: `snyk code test` might require specific project configurations or might not find issues in this overly simplistic example, but it demonstrates the command.)*

### Interpreting the Output
The output from `snyk test` will list:
*   **Vulnerabilities Found:** Details about each vulnerability.
*   **Severity:** Typically categorized as Low, Medium, High, or Critical.
*   **CVE Links:** Links to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database for more details.
*   **Path:** Shows how the vulnerable dependency is introduced into your project.
*   **Remediation Advice:** Often suggests a version to upgrade to.

### Snyk Monitor
To continuously monitor your project for new vulnerabilities after an initial scan:
```bash
snyk monitor
```
This command takes a snapshot of your current dependencies and sends it to the Snyk platform. Snyk will then notify you if new vulnerabilities affecting your project are discovered.

## 6. Remediating Vulnerabilities

Snyk provides advice on how to fix the vulnerabilities it finds.

*   **Updating Dependencies:** The most common remediation is to update the vulnerable library to a fixed version, as suggested in the `snyk test` output. You would typically edit your `requirements.txt` (or `package.json`, `pom.xml`, etc.) and then reinstall the dependencies.
*   **Snyk Wizard (for some ecosystems):** For Node.js and Ruby projects, `snyk wizard` can guide you through the remediation process, applying patches or suggesting version upgrades.
    ```bash
    # For Node.js projects, for example
    # snyk wizard
    ```
    For our Python example, manual updates to `requirements.txt` are standard.

## 7. Integrating Snyk with GitHub

Snyk offers robust integration with GitHub (and other version control systems) to automate scanning and monitoring.

1.  **Log in to Snyk:** Go to [app.snyk.io](https://app.snyk.io).
2.  **Navigate to Integrations:** Find the "Integrations" section (often a puzzle piece icon).
3.  **Connect to GitHub:**
    *   Find GitHub in the list of SCM integrations and click "Connect".
    *   You'll be redirected to GitHub to authorize Snyk. Grant access to the repositories Snyk will need to scan. You can choose to grant access to all repositories or select specific ones.
4.  **Add a Project (Repository) to Snyk:**
    *   Once connected, go to your Snyk dashboard and click "Add project".
    *   Select "GitHub" (or your connected SCM).
    *   Choose the repository you want Snyk to monitor. Snyk will analyze the repository, detect manifest files (like `requirements.txt`), and start monitoring it.
5.  **Snyk Feedback in GitHub:**
    *   **PR Checks:** Snyk can automatically scan new Pull Requests for vulnerabilities and show the results directly in the PR, preventing new vulnerabilities from being merged.
    *   **Issues:** Snyk can create GitHub issues for newly discovered vulnerabilities in your monitored repositories.
    *   **Fix PRs:** For some vulnerabilities and ecosystems, Snyk can even automatically create Pull Requests with the suggested fixes.

## 8. Snyk IDE Integration (Brief Mention)

Snyk extends its security scanning capabilities directly into your Integrated Development Environment (IDE), providing real-time feedback as you code.

*   **Supported IDEs:** Snyk offers plugins for popular IDEs such as:
    *   Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
    *   JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.)
    *   Eclipse
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Scans code and dependencies as you write.
    *   Highlights vulnerabilities directly in the editor.
    *   Provides remediation advice within the IDE.
*   **Installation:** You can typically find and install Snyk plugins from your IDE's marketplace or extension manager.
*   **Further Information:** For detailed instructions, visit the [Snyk IDEs documentation page](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-ide-tools).
