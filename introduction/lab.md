# Lab Exercises: Introduction to Ethical Hacking

These exercises are designed to help you think critically about the concepts introduced in the "Introduction to Ethical Hacking" section.

## Lab 1: Identifying Types of Hackers

**Objective:** To understand the motivations and ethics of different types of hackers.

**Task:**
1.  Read three news articles about recent cybersecurity incidents (e.g., data breaches, system outages caused by attacks, etc.). You can find these on sites like The Hacker News, Bleeping Computer, or Krebs on Security.
2.  For each incident, try to determine:
    *   What type of hacker (White Hat, Black Hat, Grey Hat, Script Kiddie, Hacktivist, State-Sponsored) was likely responsible?
    *   What were their probable motivations?
    *   What were the consequences of their actions?
3.  Write a short summary (1-2 paragraphs) for one of the incidents, explaining your reasoning for classifying the hacker type and their motivations.

## Lab 2: Analyzing a Phishing Email

**Objective:** To learn how to identify common signs of a phishing attempt.

**Task:**
1.  Search online for examples of phishing emails (many security blogs and educational sites publish these). Alternatively, if you have an old phishing email in your spam folder that you are **CERTAIN** is safe to view (no clicking links or downloading attachments!), you can use that. **Be extremely cautious.**
2.  Analyze the email for common phishing indicators:
    *   **Sender's Email Address:** Does it look legitimate? Does the domain match the supposed sender? Are there subtle misspellings?
    *   **Generic Greetings:** Does it use vague greetings like "Dear Customer" instead of your name?
    *   **Urgency or Threats:** Does it create a sense of panic, urging immediate action (e.g., "Your account will be suspended!")?
    *   **Poor Grammar/Spelling:** Are there noticeable errors?
    *   **Suspicious Links:** Hover over links (DO NOT CLICK) to see if the actual URL matches the displayed text or looks suspicious. Are they using URL shorteners for no good reason?
    *   **Unexpected Attachments:** Does it contain attachments you weren't expecting, especially ZIP files or Office documents with macros?
    *   **Requests for Sensitive Information:** Does it ask for login credentials, credit card details, or other personal information directly in the email?
3.  List at least 3-5 suspicious signs you identified in the example email.

## Lab 3: Understanding the Phases of Hacking

**Objective:** To map a hypothetical scenario to the phases of ethical hacking.

**Task:**
Imagine an ethical hacker is hired to test the security of a small company's website. Briefly outline what actions or types of activities the ethical hacker might perform during each of the five phases of hacking for this specific engagement:
1.  **Reconnaissance:**
2.  **Scanning & Enumeration:**
3.  **Gaining Access:**
4.  **Maintaining Access:**
5.  **Covering Tracks (or, for an ethical hacker, Reporting & Cleanup):**

## Lab 4: Exploring Legal and Ethical Boundaries

**Objective:** To reflect on the importance of legal and ethical guidelines in penetration testing.

**Task:**
1.  Research a real or hypothetical case where a security researcher or "ethical hacker" faced legal trouble or ethical dilemmas due to their actions (e.g., unauthorized testing, irresponsible disclosure).
2.  What went wrong?
3.  What specific legal or ethical principles were violated or overlooked?
4.  How could the situation have been handled better to stay within legal and ethical boundaries?

**Disclaimer:** These labs are for educational purposes only. Do not perform any scanning, testing, or exploitation on systems for which you do not have explicit, written permission.
