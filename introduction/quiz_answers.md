# Answers: Quiz - Introduction to Ethical Hacking

Here are the answers to the quiz found in `introduction/quiz.md`.

## Multiple Choice

1.  **What is the primary goal of ethical hacking?**
    *   **B. To identify and fix security vulnerabilities.**
    *   *Explanation:* Ethical hacking is proactive and defensive, aimed at improving security.

2.  **Which type of hacker typically has explicit permission to probe systems for vulnerabilities?**
    *   **C. White Hat Hacker**
    *   *Explanation:* White hat hackers operate with authorization. Black hats act maliciously, grey hats may operate without initial permission, and script kiddies use existing tools without deep understanding.

3.  **Which of the following is considered the FIRST phase in the ethical hacking methodology?**
    *   **C. Reconnaissance**
    *   *Explanation:* Gathering information is the initial phase before any active scanning or exploitation attempts.

4.  **A hacker who is motivated by political or social causes is best described as a(n):**
    *   **C. Hacktivist**
    *   *Explanation:* Hacktivists use hacking skills to promote their agenda.

5.  **What is the most crucial legal prerequisite before starting any penetration test?**
    *   **B. Obtaining explicit, written permission from the system owner.**
    *   *Explanation:* Unauthorized testing is illegal, regardless of intent or tools.

## True/False

6.  **True or False:** Grey Hat hackers always act illegally.
    *   **False.**
    *   *Explanation:* Grey hat actions can be ethically ambiguous and sometimes illegal if they access systems without permission, but their intent isn't always malicious, and they might disclose vulnerabilities to the owner. However, operating without permission is generally illegal.

7.  **True or False:** The "Maintaining Access" phase involves establishing a persistent presence on the target system.
    *   **True.**
    *   *Explanation:* This phase is about ensuring continued access after initial compromise.

8.  **True or False:** Ethical hackers are not concerned with legal considerations as long as their intent is good.
    *   **False.**
    *   *Explanation:* Ethical hacking is strictly bound by legal agreements and ethical guidelines. Good intent does not excuse illegal actions.

## Short Answer

9.  **Briefly describe the difference between active and passive reconnaissance.**
    *   *Answer:* Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target system (e.g., public record searches, DNS lookups from public servers). Active reconnaissance involves direct interaction with the target to gather information (e.g., port scanning, sending probes to their web server).

10. **List three examples of sensitive data that ethical hackers should aim to protect if discovered during an engagement.**
    *   *Answer:* Examples include: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like social security numbers or addresses, financial data like credit card numbers or bank account details, login credentials (usernames and passwords), private company intellectual property, and medical records. (Any three are acceptable).

11. **Why is "scope definition" important in an ethical hacking engagement?**
    *   *Answer:* Scope definition clearly outlines what systems, networks, applications, and methods are permitted for testing. It ensures the ethical hacker stays within legal boundaries, protects the client from unintended disruptions, and focuses the testing efforts on the areas of most concern to the client.

12. **What is one potential consequence for an ethical hacker if they operate outside the agreed-upon scope or legal boundaries?**
    *   *Answer:* Potential consequences include legal action (civil or criminal charges), loss of professional reputation, termination of employment or contract, and damage to client trust.
