# Networking Fundamentals for Ethical Hackers

Understanding networking is paramount for any ethical hacker. This section covers essential networking concepts, protocols, and techniques used in assessing and securing networks.

## The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

The OSI model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system in terms of seven abstraction layers. Each layer serves a specific purpose and interacts with the layers above and below it.

1.  **Layer 1 - Physical Layer:**
    *   *Purpose:* Transmits raw bit streams over a physical medium (e.g., cables, wireless signals).
    *   *Relevance to Security:* Physical access control, cable tapping, signal jamming.
    *   *Examples:* Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.

2.  **Layer 2 - Data Link Layer:**
    *   *Purpose:* Transfers data between two directly connected nodes (hops). Manages MAC addresses, framing, and error checking for physical layer transmission.
    *   *Relevance to Security:* MAC spoofing, ARP poisoning, VLAN hopping, DHCP snooping.
    *   *Protocols:* Ethernet, ARP, PPP.

3.  **Layer 3 - Network Layer:**
    *   *Purpose:* Responsible for logical addressing (IP addresses), routing, and path determination for data packets across networks.
    *   *Relevance to Security:* IP spoofing, ICMP attacks (e.g., Smurf, Ping flood), routing table poisoning, sniffing.
    *   *Protocols:* IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP, IGMP.

4.  **Layer 4 - Transport Layer:**
    *   *Purpose:* Provides reliable or unreliable data delivery between processes on different hosts. Manages segmentation, flow control, and error correction.
    *   *Relevance to Security:* Port scanning, TCP SYN floods, session hijacking, UDP floods.
    *   *Protocols:* TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

5.  **Layer 5 - Session Layer:**
    *   *Purpose:* Manages sessions (connections) between applications: establishing, maintaining, and terminating them.
    *   *Relevance to Security:* Session hijacking, DoS attacks targeting session resources.
    *   *Protocols:* NetBIOS, RPC, PPTP.

6.  **Layer 6 - Presentation Layer:**
    *   *Purpose:* Translates data between the application layer and the network format. Handles data encryption, decryption, compression, and character encoding.
    *   *Relevance to Security:* SSL/TLS vulnerabilities, man-in-the-middle attacks (related to encryption), data format exploits.
    *   *Protocols:* SSL/TLS, JPEG, ASCII, XML.

7.  **Layer 7 - Application Layer:**
    *   *Purpose:* Provides the interface for applications to access network services.
    *   *Relevance to Security:* Application-specific vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS in web apps), malware, phishing.
    *   *Protocols:* HTTP/S, FTP, SMTP, DNS, SSH, Telnet.

## TCP/IP Protocol Suite

The TCP/IP suite is the foundational set of communication protocols used on the Internet and most computer networks.

-   **IP (Internet Protocol):**
    *   Connectionless protocol operating at the Network Layer (Layer 3).
    *   Responsible for addressing hosts (IPv4, IPv6) and routing packets from a source host to a destination host across one or more IP networks.
    *   Packets can be lost, delivered out of order, or duplicated.

-   **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**
    *   Connection-oriented protocol operating at the Transport Layer (Layer 4).
    *   Provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes between applications.
    *   Establishes a connection via a "three-way handshake" (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
    *   Used for services requiring high reliability (e.g., web browsing, email, file transfer).

-   **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):**
    *   Connectionless protocol operating at the Transport Layer (Layer 4).
    *   Provides a simple, fast, but unreliable datagram service. Packets ("datagrams") may be lost, arrive out of order, or be duplicated.
    *   No handshake to establish a connection.
    *   Used for services where speed is critical and occasional data loss is acceptable (e.g., DNS, DHCP, VoIP, online gaming).

-   **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):**
    *   Network Layer protocol used by network devices, like routers, to send error messages and operational information (e.g., a requested service is not available or a host or router could not be reached).
    *   Tools like `ping` and `traceroute` use ICMP.
    *   Can be misused for attacks (e.g., ICMP flood, ping of death, Smurf attack).

## Network Sniffing and Scanning

### Network Sniffing (Packet Capturing)

Sniffing involves capturing, decoding, and analyzing network traffic. Ethical hackers use sniffers to understand network behavior, identify plaintext credentials, and detect anomalies.

**Tool: Wireshark**
Wireshark is a powerful, widely-used network protocol analyzer.

*Step-by-Step Approach:*
1.  **Installation:** Download and install Wireshark from [wireshark.org](https://www.wireshark.org). Ensure you install `npcap` (on Windows) or have appropriate permissions (on Linux) to capture packets.
2.  **Interface Selection:** Open Wireshark and select the network interface (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi) you want to capture traffic from.
3.  **Start Capture:** Click the "Start" button (shark fin icon).
4.  **Generate Traffic:** Perform network activities you want to analyze (e.g., browse a website, log into an application).
5.  **Stop Capture:** Click the "Stop" button.
6.  **Analysis:**
    *   **Display Filters:** Use display filters to narrow down traffic (e.g., `http`, `tcp.port == 80`, `ip.addr == 192.168.1.100`).
    *   **Follow Streams:** Right-click a packet and select "Follow > TCP Stream" (or UDP/TLS Stream) to reconstruct the conversation. This is useful for seeing HTTP requests/responses or chat messages.
    *   **Inspect Packets:** Examine individual packets in the packet details pane to see layer-specific information.

### Network Scanning

Scanning involves probing a network or system for live hosts, open ports, running services, and operating system versions.

**Tool: Nmap (Network Mapper)**
Nmap is a versatile open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing.

*Step-by-Step Approach (Common Scans):*
1.  **Installation:** Download Nmap from [nmap.org](https://nmap.org) or install via package managers (`sudo apt install nmap` or `sudo yum install nmap`).
2.  **Basic Ping Scan (Host Discovery):**
    *   *Command:* `nmap -sn <target_network_or_IP>` (e.g., `nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24`)
    *   *Purpose:* Discovers live hosts on the network without port scanning them.
3.  **Port Scanning (Default TCP SYN Scan):**
    *   *Command:* `nmap <target_IP_or_hostname>` (e.g., `nmap scanme.nmap.org`)
    *   *Purpose:* Scans the most common 1000 TCP ports on the target. Requires root/administrator privileges for SYN scan (`-sS`), otherwise performs a TCP Connect scan (`-sT`).
    *   *States:* Open, Closed, Filtered.
4.  **Service Version Detection:**
    *   *Command:* `nmap -sV <target_IP>`
    *   *Purpose:* Probes open ports to determine the service/version information.
5.  **OS Detection:**
    *   *Command:* `nmap -O <target_IP>` (Requires root/administrator privileges)
    *   *Purpose:* Attempts to determine the operating system of the target.
6.  **Aggressive Scan (Comprehensive):**
    *   *Command:* `nmap -A <target_IP>`
    *   *Purpose:* Enables OS detection (`-O`), version detection (`-sV`), script scanning (`-sC`), and traceroute (`--traceroute`).
7.  **Specific Port Scan:**
    *   *Command:* `nmap -p <port_list> <target_IP>` (e.g., `nmap -p 80,443,22 192.168.1.101`)
    *   *Purpose:* Scans only the specified ports.
8.  **UDP Scan:**
    *   *Command:* `nmap -sU <target_IP>`
    *   *Purpose:* Scans UDP ports (often slower and less reliable than TCP scans).

**Interpreting Nmap Output:**
-   **Open:** An application is actively accepting TCP connections, UDP datagrams or SCTP associations on this port.
-   **Closed:** A port that is accessible (it receives and responds to Nmap probe packets), but there is no application listening on it.
-   **Filtered:** Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open because packet filtering (e.g., a firewall) prevents its probes from reaching the port.
-   **Unfiltered:** The port is accessible, but Nmap is unable to determine whether it is open or closed. Only used for ACK scan.
-   **Open|Filtered:** Nmap is unable to determine whether the port is open or filtered. This happens for scan types where open ports give no response.
-   **Closed|Filtered:** Nmap is unable to determine whether a port is closed or filtered. Only used for IP ID idle scan.

## Common Network Protocols and Potential Vulnerabilities

-   **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):**
    *   *Function:* Foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.
    *   *Vulnerabilities:* Transmits data in plaintext (passwords, session cookies can be sniffed). Susceptible to various web attacks if not secured with HTTPS.
-   **HTTPS (HTTP Secure):**
    *   *Function:* Secure version of HTTP, encrypts data using SSL/TLS.
    *   *Vulnerabilities:* Weak SSL/TLS ciphers, expired certificates, misconfigurations.
-   **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):**
    *   *Function:* Transfers files between client and server.
    *   *Vulnerabilities:* Often transmits credentials in plaintext. Susceptible to bounce attacks, sniffing.

    *   *Function:* Securely access remote systems, transfer files (via SCP/SFTP), and tunnel other protocols.
    *   *Vulnerabilities:* Weak passwords, compromised keys, outdated versions with known exploits, misconfigured permissions.
-   **Telnet:**
    *   *Function:* Provides remote terminal access.
    *   *Vulnerabilities:* Transmits all data, including credentials, in plaintext. Highly insecure; SSH should always be preferred.

    *   *Function:* Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.google.com) into machine-readable IP addresses.
    *   *Vulnerabilities:* DNS spoofing, cache poisoning, zone transfer attacks, amplification attacks.
-   **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):**
    *   *Function:* Used for sending emails.
    *   *Vulnerabilities:* Open relays (can be used for spam), spoofing email addresses, sniffing if not using STARTTLS or SMTPS.
-   **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):**
    *   *Function:* Assigns IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network.
    *   *Vulnerabilities:* Rogue DHCP servers, DHCP starvation attacks.
-   **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):**
    *   *Function:* Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses on a local network.
    *   *Vulnerabilities:* ARP spoofing/poisoning (can lead to Man-in-the-Middle attacks).
